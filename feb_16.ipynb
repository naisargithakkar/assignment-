    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. Tables and formulas are helpful when communicating with data stored up to a point in a database through SQL, but a time comes when we actually want to execute some fairly complicated data interactions. We will also need the Data Manipulation Language in that situation. DML is a way to inform a database precisely what we want it to do by conversing in a manner that it has been built to comprehend from the scratch. When it comes to interacting within existing data, whether adding, moving or deleting data, it provides a convenient way to do so."
