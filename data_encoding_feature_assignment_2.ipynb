    "    When we are working on some of the datasets, we found that some of the features are categorical. We all know that machines can’t understand categorical data. Models only work with numerical values. For this reason, it is necessary to convert the categorical values of the features into numerical ones, So the machine can learn from those data and gives the right model. This process of converting categorical data into numerical data is called Encoding.\n",

Data encoding and decoding play a crucial role in data science as they act as a bridge between raw data and actionable insights, enabling us to prepare data for analysis by transforming it into a suitable format that can be processed by algorithms or models1.\n"

    "    In most scenarios, one hot encoding is the preferred way to convert a categorical variable into a numeric variable because label encoding makes it seem that there is a ranking between values 1. For example, consider a dataset containing information about different types of fruits. The dataset has a categorical variable called “Fruit” with three unique values: “Apple”, “Banana”, and “Orange”. If we use label encoding to convert this categorical variable into a numeric variable, we would assign each categorical value an integer value based on alphabetical order. In this case, “Apple” would be assigned 0, “Banana” would be assigned 1, and “Orange” would be assigned 2. However, this encoding would imply that “Banana” is greater than “Apple” and “Orange”, which is not the case 1.\n",

For example, consider a dataset containing information about different types of cars. The dataset has a categorical variable called “Color” with four unique values: “Red”, “Blue”, “Green”, and “Yellow”. Since there is no inherent order between these colors, nominal encoding would be the preferred way to convert this categorical variable into a numeric variable 2."
