    "Q5 :it is mentioned that python language is interpreted. But that is half correct the python program is first compiled and then interpreted. The compilation part is hidden from the programmer thus, many programmers believe that it is an interpreted language. The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code and internally this byte code gets converted by the python virtual machine(p.v.m) according to the underlying platform(machine+operating system)."

This is due to the fact that many applications bundle their own version of Python within them. These bundled Python installations would also be unsuitable.\n",

In the Advanced tab, click on the button Environment Variables.

Another window will pop up showing a list of paths. Click the New button and paste the path to your Python executable there. Once that’s inserted, select your newly added path and click the Move Up button until it’s at the top.\n",
