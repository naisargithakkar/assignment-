    "    When evaluating an **SVM regression model** for predicting the actual price of a house, let's consider the two commonly used metrics: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R¬≤)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual target values.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: A lower MSE indicates better performance. It penalizes larger errors more heavily.\n",
    "   - **Applicability**: MSE is suitable when you want to focus on minimizing prediction errors and need a precise understanding of how far off your predictions are from the true values.\n",
    "   - **Consideration**: However, MSE doesn't provide direct insight into the proportion of variance explained by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **R-squared (R¬≤)**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: R¬≤ quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (actual house prices) that can be explained by the independent variables (features) in your model.\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: R¬≤ ranges from 0 to 1. A higher R¬≤ indicates that a larger proportion of the variance is explained by the model.\n",
    "   - **Applicability**: R¬≤ is useful when you want to understand how well your features collectively explain the variability in the target variable.\n",
    "   - **Consideration**: R¬≤ doesn't directly penalize prediction errors; it focuses on the goodness of fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation**:\n",
    "- If your primary goal is to predict house prices as accurately as possible, **MSE** is more appropriate. Minimizing MSE ensures that your predictions are close to the actual prices.\n",
    "- However, it's also essential to monitor R¬≤ to understand how well your features collectively contribute to explaining the variability in house prices.\n",
