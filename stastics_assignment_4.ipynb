    "    he Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), of a real-valued random variable X, evaluated at x, is the probability function that X will take a value less than or equal to x. It is used to describe the probability distribution of random variables in a table. And with the help of these data, we can easily create a CDF plot in an excel sheet.\n",
    "    In other words, CDF finds the cumulative probability for the given value. To determine the probability of a random variable, it is used and also to compare the probability between values under certain conditions. For discrete distribution functions, CDF gives the probability values till what we specify and for continuous distribution functions, it gives the area under the probability density function up to the given value specified."

It indicates how many standard deviations an entity is, from the mean. In order to use a z-score, the mean μ and also the population standard deviation σ should be known. A z score helps to calculate the probability of a score occurring within a standard normal distribution. It also enables us to compare two scores that are from different samples. A table for the values of ϕ, indicating the values of the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution is termed as a z score table."

    "    The Central Limit Theorem is significant because it allows one to assume that the sampling distribution of the mean will be normally-distributed in most cases, even if the population data is not normal. This simplifies problems in statistics by allowing one to work with a distribution that is approximately normal. The theorem explains why the normal distribution arises so commonly and why it is generally an excellent approximation for the mean of a collection of data. Statistical procedures such as building confidence intervals and hypothesis testing show that the population data is normal, but the sampling data should be treated as normal even if the population data is not normal according to this theorem.\n",
